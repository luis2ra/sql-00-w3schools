SQL Hosting

If you want your web site to be able to store and retrieve data from a database, your web server 
should have access to a database-system that uses the SQL language.

If your web server is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP), you will have to look for SQL hosting plans.

The most common SQL hosting databases are MS SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and MS Access.
