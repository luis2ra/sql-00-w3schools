SQL Data Types

The data type of a column defines what value the column can hold: integer, character, money, date and time, binary, and so on.

Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.

An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. The data type 
is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how 
SQL will interact with the stored data.

Note: Data types might have different names in different database. And even if the name is the same, the size and other details 
may be different! Always check the documentation!
