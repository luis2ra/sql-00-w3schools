SQL Injection

SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database.
SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input.


SQL in Web Pages

SQL injection usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of 
a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.

Look at the following example which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtUserId) to a 
select string. The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString):

# Example:
txtUserId = getRequestString("UserId");
txtSQL = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserId = " + txtUserId;

Types of SQL Injection:

- SQL Injection Based on 1=1 is Always True
- SQL Injection Based on ""="" is Always True
- SQL Injection Based on Batched SQL Statements 


Use SQL Parameters for Protection

To protect a web site from SQL injection, you can use SQL parameters.
SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled manner.
