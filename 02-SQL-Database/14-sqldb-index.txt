SQL CREATE INDEX Statement

The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.
Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot see the indexes, 
they are just used to speed up searches/queries.

Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an 
update). So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.


# CREATE INDEX Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);


# CREATE UNIQUE INDEX Syntax
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);


Note: The syntax for creating indexes varies among different databases. 
Therefore: Check the syntax for creating indexes in your database.
