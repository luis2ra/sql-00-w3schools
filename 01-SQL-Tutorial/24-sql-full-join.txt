SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword

The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

# FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax

    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table1
    FULL OUTER JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
    WHERE condition;
