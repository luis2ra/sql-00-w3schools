SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement


The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement

The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.


SELECT DISTINCT Syntax

    SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name;


SELECT DISTINCT Examples

The following SQL statement selects only the DISTINCT values from the "Country" column in the "Customers" table:
    SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries:
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;

Other example:
    SELECT Count(*) AS DistinctCountries
    FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers);
