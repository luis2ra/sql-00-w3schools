SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause


Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. 
- MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records.
- Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.

# SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:
SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

# SQL TOP PERCENT Example (for SQL Server/MS Access)
SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;
