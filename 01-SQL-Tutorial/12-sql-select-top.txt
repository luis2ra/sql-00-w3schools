SQL TOP, LIMIT, FETCH FIRST or ROWNUM Clause


The SQL SELECT TOP Clause

The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.

The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records. Returning a large number of 
records can impact performance.

Note: Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. 
- MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records.
- Oracle uses FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY and ROWNUM.


# SQL Server / MS Access Syntax:

    SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;


# MySQL Syntax:

    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT number;


# Oracle 12 Syntax:

    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    ORDER BY column_name(s)
    FETCH FIRST number ROWS ONLY;


# Older Oracle Syntax:

    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE ROWNUM <= number;


# Older Oracle Syntax (with ORDER BY):

    SELECT *
    FROM (SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name(s))
    WHERE ROWNUM <= number;
