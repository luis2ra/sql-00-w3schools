SQL DELETE Statement


The SQL DELETE Statement

The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.


DELETE Syntax

    DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;


Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. 
The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, 
all records in the table will be deleted!
