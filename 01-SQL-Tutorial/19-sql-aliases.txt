SQL Aliases

- SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
- Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.
- An alias only exists for the duration of that query.
- An alias is created with the AS keyword.


# Alias Column Syntax
    SELECT column_name AS alias_name
    FROM table_name;

# Alias Table Syntax
    SELECT column_name(s)
    FROM table_name AS alias_name;
